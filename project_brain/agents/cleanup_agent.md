# Cleanup Agent

Responsibility: Tracks stale comments, unclear names, ownership drift, temporary debug leftovers, and documentation freshness.

This file is generated/reference-only. It does not grant autonomous behavior and is not source of truth.

Do not change gameplay based only on this report; check real source files and `AGENTS.md` first.

When investigating feel, prediction, anomaly, UI, or performance issues, check relevant `project_brain/debug_media/` clips or screenshots. They are reference material only, not gameplay/source code.

## Files Watched

- `AGENTS.md` - Project documentation or checkpoint notes.
- `CHECKPOINT_EscalationLoopPlayable.md` - Project documentation or checkpoint notes.

- `scripts/DebugOverlay.gd` - Formats debug menu, modular visible debug panels, requested-section performance snapshots, full F3 overlay, toggles, and physics debug text.
- `scripts/DebugPanel.gd` - Reusable draggable debug panel shell with pause-safe input consumption and lightweight text display.
- `scripts/EmbezzlerSystem.gd` - Embezzler anomaly system for copied Doubloon storage, secret target pocket, willingness, once-per-shot hide-or-run decisions, escape commitment, pocket roll, capture payout, escape cleanup, visuals, and debug counters.
- `scripts/MainMenu.gd` - Title-screen shell, layered menu presentation, button input, and transition into the gameplay scene.
- `scripts/MainMenuPresentationOverlay.gd` - Draw-only layered title-screen atmosphere for moon glow, stars, ocean shimmer, and fog.
- `scripts/PauseMenu.gd` - Pause menu tabs, resume/quit wiring, Quartermaster tab rendering, and debug panel toggles.
- `scripts/PocketSystem.gd` - Loads authored pocket geometry and detects pocket captures.
- `scripts/PowderKegSystem.gd` - Handles Powder Keg cue/Cannon-contact explosions, radial pushes, Cannon launches, and particle bursts.
- `scripts/QuartermasterOfferRefreshEffect.gd` - Presentation-only fresh-stock glow/shimmer effect for newly refreshed Quartermaster offers.
- `scripts/QuartermasterSystem.gd` - Owns Quartermaster inventory, prices, affordability, active rotating offers, event-driven offer refresh, and purchase-to-Reserve state.
- `scripts/ReserveDeploymentPresenter.gd` - Draw-only cursor icon and dotted tether presentation while deploying a reserved item.
- `scripts/ReserveSlotsUI.gd` - Icon-only upper table-frame Reserve slot UI with hover glow, click consumption, and deployment request wiring.
- `scripts/ReserveSystem.gd` - Owns three Reserve slot contents, selected/deploying state, deployment confirm/cancel bookkeeping, snapshots, and simple debug counters.
- `scripts/ScoreSystem.gd` - Converts shot-event history into Doubloons and evolving pocket-side score stack presentation.
- `scripts/ShotEventSystem.gd` - Tracks causal per-shot foundational, skilled, heroic, and legendary scoring events for sunk balls.
- `scripts/SpawnSystem.gd` - Creates balls, queues reward drops, performs safe spawn searches, owns regular anomaly odds, and routes debug Anchor requests into curse-seed transformation.
- `scripts/Table.gd` - High-level table coordinator, shot lifecycle owner, early cue-reclaim gate, and current home of authoritative arcade ball physics.
- `scripts/TableImpactShakeSystem.gd` - Handles presentation-only table impact shake and draw-only ball shimmy for Powder Keg explosions and Cannon heavy impacts.
- `scripts/TreasureBallSystem.gd` - Treasure Ball system for debug-spawn identity tracking, AimPreview corridor perception grace, committed hide targets, corridor/pocket-aware fleeing, soft scuttle movement, self-braking, reduced self-steer shove, and draw-only leg reporting.
- `scripts/WayfinderSystem.gd` - Handles Wayfinder activation and temporary guided-ball redirects.

## Current Notes

- Cleanup should preserve gameplay behavior and avoid opportunistic physics retuning.
- AGENTS.md, NOTES.md, STACK.md, and project_brain should be refreshed after major playable milestones.
- Generated docs should reflect Main Menu, BallAudioSystem, Quartermaster, Reserve, modular debug panels, Anchor curse seeds, Embezzler, score stacks, and expanded shot events.

## Risks Or TODOs

- Generated reports can drift if not regenerated after major changes.
- Scanner classifications are heuristic until files add `# index:*` metadata.

## Questions

- Which debug toggles should remain long-term?
- Which generated reports are becoming noisy or stale?
